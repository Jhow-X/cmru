# GPT da Câmara Regional de Caruaru do TJPE

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built for the Regional Chamber of Caruaru of the Pernambuco Court of Justice (Tribunal de Justiça de Pernambuco). The platform serves as a specialized GPT marketplace where legal professionals can discover, manage, and utilize AI-powered tools tailored for judicial work.

The application provides a Netflix-style interface for browsing legal GPTs, user management with role-based access control, and integration with OpenAI's GPT models for specialized legal assistance.

## System Architecture

### Full-Stack Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, built using Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js 
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with session-based auth
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight React router)

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Build Tool**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for backend
- **Database Driver**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Session Store**: connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL sessions
- **File Upload**: Multer for handling image uploads
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for GPT interactions

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling System**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **Theme Support**: Dark/light mode with theme provider
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop sidebar
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints under `/api` prefix
- **Middleware Stack**: Express.js with JSON parsing, CORS, session management
- **Authentication**: Passport.js Local Strategy with password hashing
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with type-safe queries
- **File Handling**: Multer for avatar/image uploads

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Authentication and profile management with role-based access (admin, magistrate, user)
- **GPTs**: Core entity storing GPT information, categories, ratings, and URLs
- **Favorites**: Many-to-many relationship between users and GPTs
- **Usage Logs**: Tracking user interactions with GPTs
- **Categories**: Organized by legal specialization areas

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials via login form
2. Passport.js validates against database using scrypt hashing
3. Session established with PostgreSQL store
4. Frontend receives user object and updates auth context
5. Protected routes check authentication status

### GPT Discovery Flow
1. Frontend requests GPT data via TanStack Query
2. Backend queries database with filters (featured, new, popular, category)
3. Data returned with pagination and sorting
4. Frontend renders in Netflix-style grid layout
5. User interactions tracked via usage logs

### Favorites Management
1. User clicks favorite button on GPT card
2. Frontend sends POST/DELETE request to favorites endpoint
3. Backend updates many-to-many relationship table
4. Query cache invalidated to reflect changes
5. UI updates optimistically with loading states

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend
- **Hot Reload**: Vite HMR for frontend, tsx watch mode for backend
- **Database**: Uses Neon serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Port Configuration**: Frontend on 5000, proxied through Express

### Production Build
- **Frontend Build**: Vite builds optimized React bundle to `dist/public`
- **Backend Build**: esbuild compiles TypeScript server to `dist/index.js`
- **Static Serving**: Express serves built frontend assets
- **Environment Variables**: Database URL, session secrets, OpenAI API key

### Replit Configuration
- **Auto-deploy**: Configured for Replit autoscale deployment
- **Build Process**: `npm run build` compiles both frontend and backend
- **Runtime**: `npm run start` serves production application
- **Port Mapping**: Internal port 5000 mapped to external port 80
